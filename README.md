Personal project to create a real-time multi-player snake game using cocos2d-html for front-end and Node.js for the back-end. 

Also using box2d for collisions. The single player version is working and posted on blackberry app store.

Multi-player version held difficult challenges such as client-server synchronization which I have not been finished yet.
